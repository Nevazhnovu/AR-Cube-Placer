# AR-Cube-Placer
In this tutorial, the user has added plane detection, reference points, and touch gesture functionality to their AR Foundation project. This project serves as a stepping stone for the user to customize the project for different use cases.

You can detect the horizontal and/or vertical plane (configurable!) with this AR app. 
And most importantly: place The Cube on them! 
Works both with Android and iOS!
